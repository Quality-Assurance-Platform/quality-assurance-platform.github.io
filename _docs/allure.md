**Allure Framework is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.**

From the dev/qa perspective Allure reports shorten common defect lifecycle: test failures can be divided on bugs and broken tests, also logs, steps, fixtures, attachments, timings, history and integrations with TMS and bug-tracking systems can be configured, so the responsible developers and testers will have all information at hand.

From the managers perspective Allure provides a clear 'big picture' of what features have been covered, where defects are clustered, how the timeline of execution looks like and many other convenient things. Modularity and extensibility of Allure guarantees that you will always be able to fine-tune something to make Allure suit you better.
